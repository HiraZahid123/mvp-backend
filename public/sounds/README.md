# Notification Sound File

Since I cannot generate actual audio files, you'll need to add a notification sound file manually.

## Instructions:

1. **Find or create a notification sound:**
   - You can download a free notification sound from sites like:
     - https://freesound.org/
     - https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/notification/
     - https://www.zapsplat.com/
   - Or create your own using audio editing software

2. **Requirements:**
   - Format: MP3
   - Duration: 1-2 seconds (short and pleasant)
   - File size: Keep it small (< 100KB recommended)
   - Volume: Moderate (not too loud or jarring)

3. **Save the file:**
   - Place it at: `public/sounds/notification.mp3`
   - The directory already exists

## Recommended Sound Characteristics:
- A gentle bell, chime, or "ding" sound
- Pleasant and non-intrusive
- Clear but not startling
- Professional tone that fits your app's aesthetic

## Alternative:
If you want to test immediately without a custom sound, you can use a data URI or find a free CDN-hosted notification sound temporarily.
